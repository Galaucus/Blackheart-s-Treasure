	description "The Freighter is designed by the Syndicate to be an efficient means of carrying cargo from system to system, but is so slow and difficult to land that most pilots hate flying them - not to mention it renders them sitting ducks if unescorted."
	description "	That simply wouldn't do for Lightspeed Logistics Solutions, who decided the most economical way to keep their fleets safe but efficient was to design an aftermarket upgrade package for the standard freighter. Implemented in a specialized shipyard adjoined to their headquarters, the Merchantman upgrade adds more speed, more gun, and more armor to an otherwise unthreatening vessel. While you certainly wouldn't want to fly one into battle, these vessels are now more than capable of safely running away from one."
	description "	Key modifications to the hull include a reduction in living quarters and cargo space in order to make room for increased fuel reserves and the increased space needed by the ship's engines and weapons. Armor plating has also been fastened stood-off from the hull, the better to absorb impacts without risking the integrity of precious cargo."

	description `The headquarters of Lightspeed Logistic Solutions appear architecturally disjointed, two incongruous designs welded together into a functional, if aesthetically incompatible station-hull. One side of the station is a massive shipment processing center, drab, utilitarian, and boasting a constant stream of cargo vessels coming and going. The other half, hosting corporate administration and headquarters, is the sort of fever-dream construction only available to spaceborne architects: soaring, gleaming structures built more for function than form, and clearly designed to impress upon any looking the importance of whatever business may happen within. Gone here are the swarms of freighters that throng the processing center, replaced instead by luxury shuttles that flit between small hangars studding the twisted, gleaming towers.`
